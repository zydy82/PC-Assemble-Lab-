# PC-Assemble-Lab-

**Reflection:**
The PC assembly quiz was a hands-on task that allowed me to solidify my understanding of computer hardware. Through the process of labeling the components and describing the steps involved in assembling a computer, I gained a clearer understanding of how each part contributes to the overall function of the machine. This task reinforced the importance of technical knowledge, attention to detail, and precision when working with hardware. It was also an opportunity to familiarize myself with the common components that I will encounter in professional settings, such as motherboards, CPUs, RAM, and storage devices. The practical nature of this task helped me grasp the assembly process in a more intuitive and engaging way. As I worked through the quiz, I became more confident in my ability to assemble and troubleshoot basic computer hardware issues. This skill will not only be useful in future coursework but will also be an asset in a professional environment, where understanding and managing hardware is often a critical component of IT support and system maintenance.
